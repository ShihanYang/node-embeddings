My experiments with transE

Todo list
- [x] Setup pipelined experiment folder
- [x] Log data in the experiment folder: params, train and eval logs
- [x] Save the best model in the experiment folder
- [ ] Save checkpoint models in the experiment folder
- [ ] Test loading a checkpointed model and framework to load an existing model
- [ ] Use tensorboard to visualize the results

- [x] Refactor into managers and core. Managers have access to core members and use them to get results.
